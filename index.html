      Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jack Brower, a Computer Science student at FSU. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This page is a short about me, and in the nav bar above you can find a few of my larger public projects, a copy of my resume, and my contact info. Below you can also find my GitHub, which contains just about everything I've worked on.
    </p>

      This site was designed to be as lightweight and effiecent as possible, while still maintaining the aesthetics, accessability, and search engine optimization of a modern website. To do this, all aspects of the page were minified, and all images were compressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website, along with all of my other work, can be found on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/jackbrower">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also occasionally use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gitlab.com/jackbrower">GitLab</a> for PRs and issue reports.
